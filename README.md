# ABOUT
Audiobook Generator is a customizable narrator â€“ specific sentence tokenizer that allows for unlimited lengths of text to be read, all while keeping proper intonation, abbreviations, decimals and more into normal human like speech.
It can read out the input text file into several languages, at different speeds, and at different volumes as provided by the user. We build our text file to audiobook using libraries such as PyPDF4, PIL, fitz, pyttsx3, etc and machine learning concept such as NLP.
