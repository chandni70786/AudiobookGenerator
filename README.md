# ABOUT
Audiobook Generator is a customizable narrator – specific sentence tokenizer that allows for unlimited lengths of text to be read, all while keeping proper intonation, abbreviations, decimals and more into normal human like speech.
It can read out the input text file into several languages, at different speeds, and at different volumes as provided by the user. We build our text file to audiobook using libraries such as PyPDF4, PIL, fitz, pyttsx3, etc and machine learning concept such as NLP.
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Software requirements:

•	Operating System - Windows 10 is used as the operating system as it is stable and supports more features and is more user friendly.
•	Tesseract-OCR (Open source OCR engine) – It is an image to text converting Optical Character Recognition library. Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine with open-source code, this is the most popular and qualitative OCR-library. OCR uses artificial intelligence for text search and its recognition on images.
•	Under Settings-Time & Language-Speech-Voices-download voices of required language.

  Front End:

•	PySimpleGUI – It is Python GUI library to create basic user interface. It is easy to use with simple yet highly customizable features of GUI for Python. It is based solely on Tkinter. It is a Python GUI For Humans that Transforms Tkinter, PyQt, Remi, WxPython into portable user-friendly Pythonic interfaces.
•	tkPDFfViewer - The tkPDFViewer is python library, which allows to embed the PDF file in the tkinter GUI.


  Back End:
  
•	pygame - pygame to play audio.
•	PyPDF4 - PyPDF4 is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging together, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. It can also add custom data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files. It can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well as merge entire files together.
•	fitz - Python bindings to MuPDF are made available by this.
•	Glob - In Python, the glob module is used to retrieve files/pathnames matching a specified pattern. The pattern rules of glob follow standard Unix path expansion rules. It is also predicted that according to benchmarks it is faster than other methods to match pathnames in directories.
•	pyttsx3 - It is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
•	os - The os module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc. You first need to import the os module to interact with the underlying operating system.
•	typing Text - Support for type hints.
•	PIL - PIL is the Python Imaging Library which provides the Python interpreter with image editing capabilities. The module also provides a number of factory functions, including functions to load images from files, and to create new images. PIL. Image. open() Opens and identifies the given image file.
